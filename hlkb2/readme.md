My second custom keyboard build which is a 40% membrane keyboard.

The motivation is that I'm a huge fan of the 40% form factor as well as the customisation that QMK provides, but didn't find the cost of building with mechanical switches worth it. Membrane keyboards have always been far cheaper than mechanical so I was interested to see if it would be possible to make a cheaper 40% QMK enabled keyboard with membrane parts.

Final Cost: TBC
